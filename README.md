# Americano-Challenge-2

This repository documents my learning journey in developing for watchOS and implementing Create ML. The project was born from the curiosity to deconstruct an existing application ("AI Rep Counter With Apple Watch") to understand the technology behind rep counting using sensors and artificial intelligence.

The final goal was to build a functional curl counting app from scratch, starting from data collection all the way to model implementation.

Learning Goals

This project was undertaken to achieve two primary objectives:

Master Create ML: To understand the process of collecting, labeling, and training a custom machine learning model for recognizing motion patterns.

Develop for watchOS: To learn how to program for the Apple Watch, capture sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) in real-time, and manage data communication between the watch and the iPhone.

Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows to showcase the entire development process:

/1_DataLoggerApp/: The first application developed, used exclusively for collecting and exporting training data.

/2_AIRepCounterApp/: The final, functional application, which includes the iPhone app (for settings) and the watchOS app (with the ML model integrated).

/Dati_Training/: A collection of the .csv files generated by the Data Logger app. This is the raw sensor data used to train the Create ML model.

/Presentazione/: Contains the script (in Italian and English) used for the final project presentation.

README.md: (This file) An overview of the project.

The Development Process

The project was divided into two distinct phases:

Phase 1: The Data Logger

To train a model, I needed data.
The 1_DataLoggerApp is a simple tool created for this purpose:

The watchOS app records accelerometer and gyroscope data at 50Hz.

Recording starts and stops manually (or with a timer).

When finished, the data is saved to a .csv file and sent to the companion iPhone app.

From the iPhone, the CSV files can be easily exported (e.g., via AirDrop) to the Mac for training.

Phase 2: The "AI Curl Counter" App

With a Create ML model trained on the CSV data, I built the 2_AIRepCounterApp application.

iPhone App: Acts as the "control center". It allows setting the desired rep goal and toggling haptic (vibration) feedback on the watch.

watchOS App: This is the core experience. The user starts their set, and the app analyzes sensor data in real-time. The ML model classifies the movements, and the app counts the repetitions. At the end of the set, a summary is sent to the iPhone.
